# Database
## Must contain a Kraken2 and Bracken database
## See database options below if you are working on SCG.

######### Downstream processing options ###################
# Downstream processing for filtering OTUs
## This removes any classification result where all samples are below this threshold,
## which serves to remove the very long tail of lowly abundant species in Kraken2/Bracken results.
## This parameter can be tuned, but I recommend you keep something here to reduce the long tail.
## This parameter is defined as a percentage, so 0.001 = 0.001%
min_otu_percentage: 0.001
# Filters for compositional data analysis, which get applied at each taxonomic level
## Keep only those samples with > 5000 reads
codata_min_reads: 1000
## Keep only OTUs with an PROPORTION of at least 0.001
## This is equivalent to a PERCENTAGE of 0.1
codata_min_prop: 0.001
## Keep OTUs that are found in at least 30% of samples
codata_otu_cutoff: 0.3
# Remove everything in the phylum Chordata?
## This helps to remove pesky human reads from the matrices and plots
remove_chordata: True
